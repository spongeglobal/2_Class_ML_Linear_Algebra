What Is a Dataframe?
DataFrame is a two-dimensional, tabular, mutable data structure in Python that can store tabular data containing objects of different data types. A DataFrame has labeled axes in the form of rows and columns. DataFrames are useful tools in data pre-processing as it provides useful methods for data handling.

What Is a Numpy Array?
A NumPy array is a type of multi-dimensional data structure in Python which can store objects of similar data types. The elements of the array are indexed by non-negative or positive integers. Arrays are mutable which means arrays can be changed after it is being formed. Arrays are a lot useful for performing mathematical operations on vectors. They provide a lot of useful methods for performing vector operations.

Agenda
1) Create Arrays (Scalar/Vector/Matrix/Tensor)
2) Convert Array to a Dataframe
3) Export Datafram to a CSV File
4) Reshape Arrays
5) Flatten 2D Arrays to 1D
